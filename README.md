# Chat Vibes

AT&T 2016 Hackathon Second Place

Chat Vibes is a Chrome Extension that uses the power of IBM's Watson API to solve one of our generations most
troubling issues: Which emoji do I choose? When typing new messages in Slack, Watson will automatically analyze
your text and insert appropriate emojis based on the tone of your text. In addition Watson will analyze the entire
conversation on the page, and give you the mood of each individual person, as well as the overall mood of the
conversation (based on a weighted average of each person's indvidual tone). No longer will you be left wondering
if the rest of the team actually enjoys your jokes, or if your manager is actually happy with your performance.
Chat Vibes, read the situation.
